    How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?

    It laid some clear goals and plans in place. I've attempted website rebuilds in the past and it's really slow and discouraging 
    if I'm trying to design as I go. I'd usually sink way too much time into a project and then draw something up, but it's already too late. 
    I really enjoyed getting a solid conceptual design sorted, and then just building what's in front of me. Along the way, my requirements did change 
    and the site felt a little different. But those changes were minor and didn't deviate from the plans too much. 


 What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?

 Before chapter 2, I thought it would be a great concept that I can incorporate into my daily routine. After chapter 2 I learned how to meditate properly 
 and also the benefits meditation brings to the table. I'm excited to take it for a whirl and see where we go from here.

 What new things have you learnt about meditation?

 I learned about the correct sitting postures, which all require you to be alert but calm at the same time. Meditation was compared to lifting weights at 
 the gym (which I'm very faimiliar with) so this made it easier to understand the benefits before, during and after meditation. 

 Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?

 The correct sitting posture really stood out to me. I do think that I'll need my eyes closed otherwise I'll be easily distracted. I also didn't realise how technical 
 and detailed the sitting posture was. 

 Any other musings?

 The book is easy to read and I love how the author also speaks their mind from time to time.
