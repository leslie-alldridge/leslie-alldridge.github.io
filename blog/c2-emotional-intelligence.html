      <ul>
            <li>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</li>
                <p>
                    I learned about the important of mindfulness in every day life. It's a powerful mindset to adopt and evovle over time, so 
                    you can react to a situation with a concious mind. Therefore, when things don't go to plan, you'll be able to control your 
                    reaction and not break down with stress or speak out with anger. 

                    It was interesting to read the scientific studies and results. I feel that I should start exploring mindfulness and seeing what 
                    it can offer. 
                </p>
            <li>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</li>
                <p>
                    It almost took the entire two minutes to achieve mindfulness, as my mind is an ongoing storage bank. I tend to not write things down
                    and leave them to roll around in my head 24/7. Over the next few days/weeks I look forward to seeing changes here. I find it easy to achieve 
                    mindfulness during karate, as I'm away from technology and it's after class when we're all exhausted.
