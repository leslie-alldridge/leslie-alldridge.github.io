            <li>What is grid based design?</li>
                <p>
                    Grid based design is used to place boxes (or other shapes) within a webpage. You can define the width of the webpage itself and fill the page with content
                    of differing sizes. For example, if you defined the page as being 12 columns wide there could be 4 x 3 column wide boxes or a single 1 x 12 box. There is 
                    lots of room to customise here. 

                    A grid based approach will help content stay in a particular alignment when the webpage is responsive in nature. The grid isn't static and if you define 12 columns regardless of
                    the page width, 12 columns will appear either side by side or stacked one above another. If we weren't using grid based design principles, it would be a mission
                    plotting out a static area using x and y axis to create content. Furthermore, if the page shrinks you'd lose the content from the current view.
                </p>
            <li>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</li>
                <p>
                    Responsive webpages are very important as a myriad of devices are in existance. We don't have one set aspect ratio and screen resolution anymore. 
                    Tablets, cell phones, laptops and ultra wide monitors to name a few. When creating webpages we need to be cautious that our content is visible on mobile and 
                    desktop devices. When building my blog from the start, I've been using percentages in order to achieve a responsive web page. This way, if the 
                    window is resized, my content within will still be 60% or 20% of the page, and shrink along with the browser window. 

                    To take this further, I look forward to integrating a hamburger navbar menu - as the number of blog posts grow my navbar will start to struggle 
                    on a mobile device. It worked as of HTML, CSS & DOM Part One - but it'll be interesting to see how many blogs it can take before not looking nice on mobile.
                </p>
            <li>What is semantic structure?</li>
                <p> 
                    I understand semantic structure as being the correct layout (organisation) for a website. This can be as simple as having the correct order of elements (head, body, etc). 
                    Semantic structure also goes deeper. If you're using a stylesheet, you wouldn't expect to see font coloring defined using HTML and font face (or style) set using CSS.
                    
                    In addition, ID's, classes and other attributes should have names that make sense. The top navbar wouldn't be called 'footer' or 'content'. Usually, it would
                    have the name navbar or navigation. 

                    Comments can be really helpful in defining structure and personally I use div container a lot as this makes it easy to find where the actual content begins.

            <li>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</li>
                <p>
                    I found my paragraph tags failed verification. Generally, you wouldn't have paragraph tags inside a list item element. However, 
                    further research shows while it's not semantic (or perfect), the functionality of the page isn't impacted at all. 

                    I'll have to clarify with a tutor to see what other options are available. I tried using span tags, but those also didn't pass. I did further
                    research but couldn't find a conclusive answer. Maybe there isn't one.
