                    Time & Habits - Setting some rules and timing my work</a>
                  </h4>

                    <ul class="answers">
                    <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
                        <p>During the first part of EDA I didn't understand how important it was to timebox.
                            When setting myself a new challenge, such as finishing Sprint 1, I'd commit every waking minute of my day.
                            This would lead to excellent output in day 1, but no further output for the rest of the week due to being burned out. 
                            I'm loving the Toggl application and find this helps me focus and feel a light but persistent time pressure. 
        
                            Part of my habits when studying from home is the ability to put music on and find my flow. If I'm still nodding my head to a beat
                            even though it's during a song change, that's how I know I'm flowing. Right now, I'm feeling in the zone and focused. This page is flying infront of my eyes. 
        
                            I look forward to trying out other techniques over time to see which ones will have the greatest impact. 
                        </p>
                    <li>What did you find interesting?</li>
                        <p>It was interesting to find myself amongst the learning material. I'd never had read or understood the importance otherwise. 
                            My normal Monday evening definitely hasn't included meditation or reading up on new methods to improve my focus and time commitments. 
                            It will be good to start making a habit of this so I can evolve as a person. 
                        </p>
                    <li>What worked for you?</li>
                        <p>At the moment, listening to music and blocking out external sound is working from home. During the bootcamp I believe 
                            I'll be trying meditation and yoga. Possibly even the 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off, type of workload. 
        
                            Again, I'm loving timing myself and time boxing activities. This keeps me focused and not clicking around on other things. It's easy
                            to think "Ah, I'll Google this bit of code...10 minutes later...YouTube...Email...News..". 
        
                            Finding my flow is becoming easier and I'll try master this further. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
                        <p>Whoops! I covered this above. I will experiment with ways to find my flow faster and maintain it. This really
                            resonated well with me, as I have a full time job in technical support - some days you fly through the work at take lunch an hour before going home. 
                            Other days, you struggle over and over but have no idea why you feel overworked, but have such low output.

                      <li>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</li>
                          <p>
                              I learned about the important of mindfulness in every day life. It's a powerful mindset to adopt and evovle over time, so 
                              you can react to a situation with a concious mind. Therefore, when things don't go to plan, you'll be able to control your 
                              reaction and not break down with stress or speak out with anger. 
          
                              It was interesting to read the scientific studies and results. I feel that I should start exploring mindfulness and seeing what 
                              it can offer. 
                          </p>
                      <li>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</li>
                          <p>
                              It almost took the entire two minutes to achieve mindfulness, as my mind is an ongoing storage bank. I tend to not write things down
                              and leave them to roll around in my head 24/7. Over the next few days/weeks I look forward to seeing changes here. I find it easy to achieve 
                              mindfulness during karate, as I'm away from technology and it's after class when we're all exhausted. 
                          </p>
