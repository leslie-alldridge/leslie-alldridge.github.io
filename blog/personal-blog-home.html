                    <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
                        <p>During the first part of EDA I didn't understand how important it was to timebox.
                            When setting myself a new challenge, such as finishing Sprint 1, I'd commit every waking minute of my day.
                            This would lead to excellent output in day 1, but no further output for the rest of the week due to being burned out. 
                            I'm loving the Toggl application and find this helps me focus and feel a light but persistent time pressure. 
        
                            Part of my habits when studying from home is the ability to put music on and find my flow. If I'm still nodding my head to a beat
                            even though it's during a song change, that's how I know I'm flowing. Right now, I'm feeling in the zone and focused. This page is flying infront of my eyes. 
        
                            I look forward to trying out other techniques over time to see which ones will have the greatest impact. 
                        </p>
                    <li>What did you find interesting?</li>
                        <p>It was interesting to find myself amongst the learning material. I'd never had read or understood the importance otherwise. 
                            My normal Monday evening definitely hasn't included meditation or reading up on new methods to improve my focus and time commitments. 
                            It will be good to start making a habit of this so I can evolve as a person. 
                        </p>
                    <li>What worked for you?</li>
                        <p>At the moment, listening to music and blocking out external sound is working from home. During the bootcamp I believe 
                            I'll be trying meditation and yoga. Possibly even the 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off, type of workload. 
        
                            Again, I'm loving timing myself and time boxing activities. This keeps me focused and not clicking around on other things. It's easy
                            to think "Ah, I'll Google this bit of code...10 minutes later...YouTube...Email...News..". 
        
                            Finding my flow is becoming easier and I'll try master this further. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
                        <p>Whoops! I covered this above. I will experiment with ways to find my flow faster and maintain it. This really
                            resonated well with me, as I have a full time job in technical support - some days you fly through the work at take lunch an hour before going home. 
                            Other days, you struggle over and over but have no idea why you feel overworked, but have such low output.

                      <li>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</li>
                          <p>
                              I learned about the important of mindfulness in every day life. It's a powerful mindset to adopt and evovle over time, so 
                              you can react to a situation with a concious mind. Therefore, when things don't go to plan, you'll be able to control your 
                              reaction and not break down with stress or speak out with anger. 
          
                              It was interesting to read the scientific studies and results. I feel that I should start exploring mindfulness and seeing what 
                              it can offer. 
                          </p>
                      <li>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</li>
                          <p>
                              It almost took the entire two minutes to achieve mindfulness, as my mind is an ongoing storage bank. I tend to not write things down
                              and leave them to roll around in my head 24/7. Over the next few days/weeks I look forward to seeing changes here. I find it easy to achieve 
                              mindfulness during karate, as I'm away from technology and it's after class when we're all exhausted. 
                          </p>

                    <li>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</li>

    <p>It laid some clear goals and plans in place. I've attempted website rebuilds in the past and it's really slow and discouraging 
    if I'm trying to design as I go. I'd usually sink way too much time into a project and then draw something up, but it's already too late. 
    I really enjoyed getting a solid conceptual design sorted, and then just building what's in front of me. Along the way, my requirements did change 
    and the site felt a little different. But those changes were minor and didn't deviate from the plans too much. </p>


    <li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</li>

    <p>Before chapter 2, I thought it would be a great concept that I can incorporate into my daily routine. After chapter 2 I learned how to meditate properly 
 and also the benefits meditation brings to the table. I'm excited to take it for a whirl and see where we go from here.</p>

 <li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</li>

 <p>I learned about the correct sitting postures, which all require you to be alert but calm at the same time. Meditation was compared to lifting weights at 
 the gym (which I'm very faimiliar with) so this made it easier to understand the benefits before, during and after meditation. </p>

 <li>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</li>

 <p>The correct sitting posture really stood out to me. I do think that I'll need my eyes closed otherwise I'll be easily distracted. I also didn't realise how technical 
 and detailed the sitting posture was. </p>

 <li>Any other musings?</li>

 <p>The book is easy to read and I love how the author also speaks their mind from time to time. </p>

                    <li>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</li>

    <p>
      I learned that listening to others is very important and benefits both parties. I tend to be a rapid fire machine when it comes to talking. This way, I 
      say everything that I think needs to be said, and then my mind is ready to move on to the next agenda. However, this book has taught me that I need to 
      enable others to have the opportunity to also speak their thoughts. In this situation, I need to become a better listener. It won't happen overnight, but being 
      aware of the issue is a good first step for now. 
    </p>


    <li>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</li>

    <p>
      Taking one breath a day. It's good to start somewhere, even if that somewhere is quiet small and not the end goal. I can always revisit if the need arises, 
      and if it doesn't, I can be satisfied that I've banked my one breath of mindfulness that day. 
    </p>

 <li>Any other musings?</li>

 <p>I look forward to dedicating more of my time to listening to others effectively.  </p>

                    <ul class="answers">
                    <li>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</li>

    <p>
      Mindfulness is about separating the mind and focusing on your existence. Picture it as if you're looking down and observing your 
      human structure, learning from interactions and actions. Self awareness is a skill that helps you achieve mindfulness. Self awareness 
      is about analysing what does and doesn't impact you. For example, you could say "I'm experiencing sadness" instead of "I'm sad". Instantly, 
      after writing "I'm sad" I feel down. However, the first example "I'm experiencing sadness" gives one hope that the feeling is likely to pass soon. 
    </p>


    <li>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</li>

    <p>
      I tried to journal as I felt it would be best to write everything down and I didn't want to risk sleeping during the body scan. Journaling was easy to do and 
      really effective. It helped clear my mind from stressful situations and I feel like my concentration has increased.  
    </p>

 <li>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</li>

 <p>This was probably the best section in the chapter to be honest. It really hit home just like day one where I learned to 
   stop saying 'you guys', and become aware of the language I'm using. In the future I'll definitely be correcting myself and others 
  where possible, to remember that feelings aren't who we are. Many people out there could be feeling trapped, lonely and sad. It sits on my 
mind that a simple change of perspective could really help them out.  </p>
