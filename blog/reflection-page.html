                                              <p>It's a new experience for myself. I'm still soaking it in. The study from home section is surprisingly fast paced. I think
                                                  what I was missing during coding sessions, is the supporting tools such as Waffleboard (or Trello) and time tracking software. These tools definitely 
                                                  make myself aware that it's time to be serious and treat my actions as if I was a contracting developer at this point in time.
                                              </p>
                                          <li>What are your impressions?</li>
                                              <p>My first impressions are good. I feel that even thought we're covering the basics at the moment, 
                                                  there's no rock left unturned. I've created some basic websites before, but the idea of using
                                                  GitHub did scare me a little. Maybe because I was using Windows at the time and struggled to set up
                                                  Git Bash. It's very helpful that all of the content is on GitHub as it's an essential tool in the current
                                                  web development world.
                                              </p>
                                          <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
                                              <p>I'm really looking forward to meeting others and engaging during the bootcamp. I know a few current and future students,
                                                  so I'll be keeping in contact with them. For the first part, I'm doing Phase 0 over 18 weeks so it's a bit challenging to 
                                                  find others who are at my current stage (most of them are doing one week sprints). Hopefully we can meet up for a coffee
                                                  some time and code together!
                                              </p>
                                          <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
                                              <p>Not at all. I did research quite thoroughly and asked lots of questions before signing up. I also read over the course
                                                  curriculum before starting and measured that against my current skill. I did half expect that you could fly ahead and make 
                                                  over the top websites, but it's probably for my own benefit that I slow down and master the basics. Therefore, this site will 
                                                  stay as HTML for the purpose of sprint 1, even though I'd love to add CSS and a few extra libraries. 
                                              </p>
                                          <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
                                              <p>Super excited and not nervous at all. I can't wait to dive in and fully commit to becoming the best developer I can be. I'm taking the course
                                                  very seriously and look forward to having nine weeks off work. During those nine weeks I feel like I'll be in my element and 
                                                  I hope that all other students are ready to rock and roll!
