      <h1>HTML, CSS & DOM</h1>
      <ul>
            <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</li>
                <p>
                    If we were to think of HTML, CSS and the DOM in terms of a car. The HTML would be the shell of the car, seats, engine and other parts the car
                    need to run. The CSS would be the color of the shell, color of the seats and other style elements the car has. The DOM is an action, so when
                    the key is turned, the engine starts. The window going down is the DOM as it's manipulating the window to become smaller. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you can see plain html text. Like the car without paint or any features (scrolling windows, started engine).
                    Now let's paint the car <span class="red">red</span> and the seats <span class="black">black</span> using CSS.
                    Lastly, when the user clicks <span class="click">here</span> we can watch the <span class="car">car</span>drive away using the DOM.
                </p>
            <li>What is meant by boxifying design?</li>
                <p>It was interesting to find myself amongst the learning material. I'd never had read or understood the importance otherwise. 
                    My normal Monday evening definitely hasn't included meditation or reading up on new methods to improve my focus and time commitments. 
                    It will be good to start making a habit of this so I can evolve as a person. 
                </p>
            <li>What is the box model?</li>
                <p>At the moment, listening to music and blocking out external sound is working from home. During the bootcamp I believe 
                    I'll be trying meditation and yoga. Possibly even the 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off, type of workload. 

                    Again, I'm loving timing myself and time boxing activities. This keeps me focused and not clicking around on other things. It's easy
                    to think "Ah, I'll Google this bit of code...10 minutes later...YouTube...Email...News..". 

                    Finding my flow is becoming easier and I'll try master this further.
