      <h1>HTML, CSS & DOM</h1>
      <ul>
            <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</li>
                <p>
                    If we were to think of HTML, CSS and the DOM in terms of a car. The HTML would be the shell of the car, seats, engine and other parts the car
                    needs to run. The CSS would be the color of the shell, color of the seats and other style elements the car has. The DOM is an action, so when
                    the key is turned, the engine starts. The window going down is the DOM as it's manipulating the window to become smaller. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you can see plain html text. Like the car without paint or any features (scrolling windows, started engine).
                    Now let's paint the car <span class="red">red</span> and the seats <span class="blue">blue</span> using CSS.
                    Lastly, when the user clicks the button below we can watch the car drive away using the DOM.
                    <img class="" id="car" src="/leslie-alldridge.github.io/images/car.png" alt="car"/>
                    <button onclick="carDrive()">Let's Drive</button>
                            <!-- java below to make car drive -->
                            <script>
                                function carDrive() {
                                    var carclass = document.getElementById("car");
                                    carclass.classList.toggle("cardrive");
                                }
                            </script>
                            <!-- java ends -->
                </p>
            <li>What is meant by boxifying design?</li>
                <p>
                    Boxifying design is when you can design a web page using a series of boxes. At first, you'll see a logo and header, content and some kind of navigation bar or menu. 
                    The challenge here, is to reduce all of this content into their own individual (or grouped) boxes. This enables us to create the website using boxes. Each div will equal 
                    one box. 

                    You can use tools outside of coding to best visualise the webpage as a series of boxes. I'll probably draw my new design down and/or cut it out into boxes 
                    using paper and scissors. It's important to understand the boxifying design of a webpage - otherwise it's very difficult to float and align content nicely on a page.
                </p>
            <li>What is the box model?</li>
                <p> 
                    The box model is a concept where every HTML element can be packed into a box. Each box can have its own order, direction, padding, margin and many other styles. Using
                    CSS we will be able to change how the box appears. With the box model you can easily edit/style lots of content at once, or each individual piece of content one by one. 
                    Because all smaller boxes are nested within a large box, you could add a page border and background color, but select the smaller boxes and give those a contrasting background color and their own individual borders.
